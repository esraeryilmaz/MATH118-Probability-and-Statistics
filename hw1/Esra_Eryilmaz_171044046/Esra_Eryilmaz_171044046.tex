\homework{Homework \#1}{Due: 26/04/21}{Dr. Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos}{Gizem S\"ung\"u}{Esra EryÄ±lmaz}{171044046}
\textbf{Course Policy}: Read all the instructions below carefully before you start working on the assignment, and before you make a submission.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is not a group homework. Do not share your answers to anyone in any circumstance. Any cheating means at least -100 for both sides. 
\item Do not take any information from the Internet.
\item No late homework will be accepted. 
\item For any questions about the homework, come to my office hour.
\item After the office hour, no questions about the homework by email will be responded.
\item Submit your homework (both your latex and pdf files in a zip file) into the course page of Moodle.
\item Save your latex, pdf and zip files as "Name\_Surname\_StudentId".\{tex, pdf, zip\}.
\item The deadline of the homework is 22/04/21 23:55.
\end{itemize}

\problem{1}{100}

Homework 1 considers a Covid-19 dataset which is published on \href{https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data}{Github}. Please download any document type that you prefer of the dataset from the links which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pic}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
	
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pic.png}
	\caption{The complete dataset links}
	\label{fig:pic}
\end{figure}
The dataset is updated daily and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalizations, testing, and vaccinations as well as other variables of potential interest. The data set has the following basic columns:
\begin{itemize}
	\item iso\_code: Short name of the country
	\item continent: The continent where the country exists
	\item location: The country name
	\item date: The date when the data about various variables are taken. 
\end{itemize}

You are responsible to implement a program which reads the given dataset from the file and computes the data for the following questions. Any programming language that you prefer will be accepted. Putting comments on your functions that you implement is must. Each question must be appended to a file which is called "output\{.csv, .txt\}". The file contains the first 18 questions listed below. The 18th question will be written in this document.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1. ] How many countries the dataset has?
	\item[2. ] When is the earliest date data are taken for a country? Which country is it?
	\item[3. ] How many cases are confirmed for each country so far? Print pairwise results of country and total cases.
	\item[4. ] How many deaths are confirmed for each country so far? Print pairwise results of country and total deaths.
	\item[5. ] What are the average, minimum, maximum and variation values of the reproduction rates for each country?

\textbf{Some notes:}\\
$\rightarrow${ Nan values in output.txt indicates that there is no value in excel.}\\
$\rightarrow${ I did not put the 18th question in output.txt because I have already printed each problem one by one.}
